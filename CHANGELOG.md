#### 📄 `CHANGELOG.md`
```markdown

## v8.0.0 — 2025-09-18
### Added
- 🏟️ **Events support**:
  - The bot can now be linked to multiple PvP events (e.g., different arenas or tournaments).
  - Each event is associated with its own text channel and webhook.
  - Stats commands (`/top`, `/topmmr`, `/mystats`, `/stats`) now include an `event` parameter to filter results per event.
  - If the parameter is not specified, the **default event** (`arena`) is used.
  - 👑 **Roles** are still assigned **only for the default event**.

- 🆕 New admin commands:
  - `/createevent` — create a new event.
  - `/setchannel` — bind a channel to an event (both track+announce).
  - `/clearchannel` — unbind a channel from an event.
  - `/listevents` — list all events with their assigned channels.

### Changed
- 🔄 Announcement logic refactored: `track` and `announce` have been merged into the `/setchannel` command.
- ✏️ Removed deprecated commands:
  - `/style`
  - `/announce` (replaced by `/setchannel`)
  - `/track` (replaced by `/setchannel`)

### Fixed
- 🐛 Fixed desynchronization between **online MMR calculation** (real-time) and deep analysis (`/mmrsync`).
  - Now `/mmrsync` is only required after a reset (`/mmrclear`) or when restoring the database from a backup.

### Migration Notes
- ⚠️ Users with **legacy databases** are strongly advised to:
  - Make a backup,
  - Delete the old database,
  - Let the bot create a fresh one on startup.
- 📌 Reason: migrating from the old schema to the new event model is complex and may cause errors.

## v7.0.0 — 2025-06-20
### Added
- 📈 Advanced **matchmaking rating system** (Glicko-2): rating, deviation (RD), and volatility
- 🧮 New rating commands:
  - `/topmmr`, `/mmr`, `/mmrlog`, `/mmrsync`, `/mmrclear`
- 👑 Role assignment based on MMR:
  - `/mmrroles`, `/mmrroleset`, `/mmrroleupdate`, `/mmrroleclear`
- 🧾 MMR history logging via `glicko_history` table
- 📊 Rating info integrated into `/top`, `/stats`, `/mystats`
- 💀 New streak-break announcements:
  - Dynamic embed and `obezhiren.wav` sound when a streak ends

### Changed
- ✏️ Default rating display now shows MMR (instead of legacy Elo)
- 🧹 Removed legacy logic:
  - `ratings` table, `update_mmr`, `apply_decay`, and related functions
- 📉 Deprecated the old point-based auto-role system
- 🧼 Removed commands:
  - `/autoroles`, `/autorolestatus`, `/autoroletimeout`
- 🧱 Updated build pipeline:

  - Nuitka 2.7 compatibility with standalone assets

### Fixed
- 🐛 Resolved all `Pylance` and typing warnings (`guild_permissions`, `send`, etc.)

    - Wins, losses, winrate %, and new **win/loss ratio** (`winlos`).
